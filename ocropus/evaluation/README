=== pageeval-run [directory] > eval.log ===

Runs OCR on each PNG file in the given directory (default:
../data/pages) for which ground truth is present (.png replaced
with .txt).  It then computes the edit distance for a range of block
move costs and outputs the result.

=== pageeval-plot < eval.log ===

Plots the results from the pageeval-run output.

You must have Matplotlib/Pylab installed for this to work.

=== bad-line-check [directory] ===

Runs "ocropus linerec" on each PNG file in the given directory and
outputs a list of line images on which OCR appears to fail.
